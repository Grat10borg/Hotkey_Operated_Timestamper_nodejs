# Hotkey_Operated_Timestamper_nodejs
a smaller impementation of H.O.T in node.js and is the successor of H.O.T

this version currently only runs in a terminal and does not have twitch-stamps!

note: if a recording/stream does not have more than a start time and end time (no timestamps & scene changes) it won't export it

## running hot
you can run it by opening up a terminal and writing `hot` you can run `hot -h` or `hot --help` for more infomation.

to export local timestamps run `hot export` or for help `hot export -h` to export your timestamps to the exports folder.

## making your description

to make your description you have a few options, first in the description folder you can make txt files which will be put either before or after your timestamps.

in your config.js you can add more languages or changing how the timestamp decorations look.

this is how the config.js looks currently

```
// specifies the tag & gathering point for english timestamps
let english = {
	print_out_code: "[eng]",
	before_path: "./description/beforeTimestamps.txt",
	after_path: "./description/afterTimestamps.txt",
};

exports.config = {
	timestamp_path: "timestamps.txt",
	


	// an array holding objects of differing languages.
	descs: [
		english
	       ],
	export_to: "./exports/",

	// purely for personization
	hotkey_dot: "•",
	scene_dot: "•-•",
	starting_dot: "•--▸",
	starting_screen_name: "intro",

	// makess H.O.T also print the hours in timestamp.txt names
	turn_off_timestamp_extended_date: true,
	// stops H.O.T from making desciptions, outputs only timestamps
	turn_off_timestamp_only: true,
	// makes 0:00 into 0:00:00 
	turn_off_timestamp_shortener: false,
};
```

you can also add more langauges by making another object like the `english` one and adding it to the `descs` array on line 37
``` `
